# Deep-Learning-based-Brain-Tumors-Detection
The brain is the most important organ in the human body, responsible for controlling and  regulating all critical life functions for the body and a tumor is a mass of tissue formed by the  accumulation of abnormal cells, which keep on growing. A brain tumor is a tumor which is  either formed in the brain or has migrated No primary cause has been identified for the  formation of tumors in the brain till date. Though tumors in the brain are not very common  (Worldwide brain tumors make up only 1.8% of total reported tumors), the mortality rate of  malignant brain tumors is very high due to the fact that the tumor formation is in the most  critical organ of the body. Hence, it is of utmost importance to accurately detect brain tumors  at early stages to lower the mortality rate.
